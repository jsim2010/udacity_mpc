## Discussion

### Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations

The state of the vehicle includes the following: x, y, psi, speed, throttle, steering angle, and some waypoints that indicate the desired path. These variables are processed and then provided to the MPC procedure. The MPC procedure returns the desired throttle and steering angle actuator values for the vehicle to execute.

The MPC procedure operates by calculating the cost of modifying the actuators for N timesteps and choosing the actuator values that produce the smallest cost. This cost is composed of the following values:
- cte
- epsi
- difference between velocity and a reference velocity set to 40
- steering angle
- acceleration
- difference between consecutive steering angles
- difference between consecutive accelerations

After much trial and error, I found that strongly weighting the epsi value in the cost resulted in good behavior. This causes the vehicle to avoid over-correcting towards the desired path. Only a very slight weight to the cte was needed to ensure the vehicle stayed near the desired path. Additionally, adding some weight to the steering and acceleration values resulted in smoother movements.

### Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried

The dt was chosen to be 0.1 seconds. This was choosen because it matched the actuator latency. A timestep length of 10 was choosen to provide a decent amount of vision into the future without causing the calculation to take too long. No previous values were tried.

### If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described

The waypoints were preprocessed to generate a 3rd degree polynomial that described the line that best fit the waypoints. This line was then used as the desired path from which cte and epsi were calculated.

### Student provides details on how they deal with latency

I dealt with the 100ms latency by giving values to the MPC procedure that represented an estimate of the state of the vehicle 100ms in the future. Thus, the calculated acutator values would be for 100 ms in the future, which is when they would actually be processed.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Build with Docker-Compose
The docker-compose can run the project into a container
and exposes the port required by the simulator to run.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Build image: `docker-compose build`
3. Run Container: `docker-compose up`
4. On code changes repeat steps 2 and 3.

## Tips

1. The MPC is recommended to be tested on examples to see if implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, it tracks the reference line after some timesteps(not too many).
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has waypoints of the lake track. This could fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We have kept editor configuration files out of this repo to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. We omitted IDE profiles to ensure
students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. Most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
